# CE 640 / OC 512 - Matlab Programming

This repository is for CE640/OC512 at Oregon State University. Each week, you will find a series of scripts (.m) files and live scripts (.mlx) files for use during class and also (most weeks) a homework assignment. In each week's folder in the scripts folder, please start with the readme.md file located there.

Most of what follows below is relevant only to OSU students. Those students, and other interested people, should next turn to the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

**Engineering Accounts**
If you have not yet done so, you should get and engineering account. Why? Well, to log in to the computers in Owen Hall, you will need one. Those of you who are engineering students already have one. Those of you who are not will need to get one. You can get one at https://teach.engr.oregonstate.edu. Now, when using an engineering account, your work can be stored on your engineering 'stak' space (i.e., your 'Z' drive). If you wish to leave all of your work here and then access it remotely, you can do so by mapping the network drive. Instructions are at: https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/accessing-engineering-file-space. 

**Your Matlab Options**
A great resource summarizing your options for using Matlab is here: https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/matlab. To briefly summarize...YES, you can download a version onto your own personal computer. YES, you can use a computer provided to you by your graduate adviser. And YES, you can come to campus and use a computer lab. A decent list of engineering computer labs is here: https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/computer-labs. As a final note, you can use Citrix. Think of this as a ‘remote desktop’ approach. It is not a local download of Matlab onto your personal computer. Rather, you are launching an instance of Matlab remotely. The good thing about this is that it will know if your ENGR account is enabled and it will launch in your Z drive. For information on how to use Citrix, go here: https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/citrix. 

**Communications**
I would very much like to encourage you to use the discussions section of Canvas as a way to seek help and ask questions. It is common that any challenge you encounter with an assignment is one that other students will be encountering. By posting questions (and answers) online, all students can benefit. This is not a requirement, of course, and you can email me directly or come see me in office hours (best option!!), but having a _community_ discussion board is a nice addition.

**GitHub Account**
As I will explain in Week 1, I will be administering this course more or less through GitHub. Why? GitHub is an essential tool for helping you track your codes and changes that you make to them. I highly encourage you to learn how to use GitHub as you progress through your graduate studies and beyond. Note: Git (different from GitHub) in general is a bit complex and takes some time to learn. You CAN learn to use Git via a command window / terminal window. OR...you can more or less use all of the functionality of Git and GitHub through the use of GitHub Desktop, which is a piece of software available on both Mac and PC. We will cover all of this during the first week of class. For now, please arrive at the first week of class with a GitHub account already created. Go here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account.
