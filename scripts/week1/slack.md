# Slack
So, there are tons of resources online in terms of learning the basics of Slack. Why use this and not Canvas? Because it is much nicer for creating threads regarding, for example, questions on homework. I would like to HIGHLY encourage you to use Slack discussions for homework help. Absolutely come see me during office hours, but Slack is nice since I can respond quickly, and you all can help to answer each others question. So, you will see something like this:

Note that there are several *channels* for you to choose from. Let's say that someone wanted to post a question in the homework channel because their code didn't work as expected. That person might post something like:

![slack2](../../images/slack2.jpg)

Ok. Well, first of all, this is not a very good way to ask for help. The person just threw up code and said it didn't work. But, they didn't give any indication that they had thought about why it didn't work. They didn't give any indication that they had tried things X, Y, and Z to fix the code. And so on. So, say your wanted to reply to this question. PLEASE use threads. Hover over the post and choose the *bubble* icon to reply.

Since this question was not asked in the best way, the poser of the question might get an unhelpful reply such as the following. Note that this has now created a thread, rather than starting a new post.

So, let's say that the person asked a more well-thought-out question about their code, such as the following. Note: you can use features like code block to visually distinguish code from question.

And, generally speaking, well-asked questions are like to get more helpful and targeted responses such as:
