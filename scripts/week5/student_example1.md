# In-Class Exercise 1
Ok, let's stop for a few moments. I'd like to give you a short exercise. Please create a script that will do the following:

* Define vector x ranging from 0 to 2*pi. 
* Calculate vector y = sin (x)
* Define (you get to pick) some arbitrary level between -1 and 1.
* Make a plot of the sin wave
* The portion of the sin wave 'above' the level will be red.
* The portion of the sin wave 'below' the level will be green.
* Also plot a horizontal line at the level itself in blue.

Ok? Now...you can make this really hard, or you can make it easy. Here are some hints: Maybe think about plotting two waves, each in a different color. And, note that anytime you have part of a vector that is NaNs, those values don't plot. You can use this to your advantage...

Add labels to both axes. Add a legend, with suitably named entries. If you have time, use handle graphics to set the font to be Arial. Size 16.

After we are done with this, we will head back to [class5_1.mlx](class5_1.mlx).
