%% Week 2 Part 3 - Matlab Class
%% Dave Hill
% This will look at strings, string functions, and other useful data types. 
% What we saw in the previous section was pretty much all about numbers (integers 
% and floating point)

%% String Basics
% Ok, to this point, most of what we have talked about has dealt with vectors 
% and matrices of numeric values (either integer or floating point). We definitely 
% have need to work with other data types, however. A string is simply a sequence 
% of alphanumeric characters. Let's try! Below, you see a string...but what 
% is it's size, and can we access certain portions of it??

t = 'This is a character string'
size(t)
t(3)
u = t(1:7)

%% Converting Between Data Types
% Can we convert between a string and an integer? What happens (ummmm...) if 
% we try to convert the variable t to an integer? Yeah, no. In matlab, a string 
% is really a vector that contains numeric codes for the characters. Codes 0 
% to 127 are ASCII. So each 'letter' or 'character' is mapped to an integer. 
% Not super helpful. Ok, let's stick to numbers. Can numbers be strings and 
% vice versa?

int8(t) %convert string to number?
t = '4' %this looks like a number...
sqrt(t) %but it does not behave like a number.

%% 
% Nope, that didn't work. t is the 'string' 4 and not the number 4. But, we 
% can switch back and forth!

sqrt(str2num(t))    %that should work

%str2num, num2str, and other functions like these are massively helpful
%once we start working with data files

%% Combining Strings
% Next, we can concatenate strings, just like we can concatenate vectors and 
% matrices. We can simply combine the individual strings within square brackets. 
% There are also built in functions in M

var1='Have ';
var2='a ';
var3='good ';
var4='day!';
var5=[var1 var2 var3 var4]
var6=strcat(var1,var2,var3,var4) %strcat removes trailing spaces, beware!

%% String Functions
% Finally, there are TONS of 'string functions' in Matlab. Type 'help strfun' 
% at the command prompt. Find, compare, replace, the list goes on...Here is a 
% simple example of 'strcmp' which is a boolean function that compares two strings. 
% See if you can figure out why this one comes back false.

var1='string'
var2='String'
strcmp(var1,var2)   %not equal...

%% Character Arrays
% So, 'arrays' or 'matrices' in matlab are a powerful concept. We are basically 
% storing information (often numbers) in various 'boxes' that make up a rectangular 
% grid (so many columns by so many rows). The usual matrix in Matlab is not really 
% well equipped for storing strings, however. So, we can use character arrays 
% to accomplish this. Let us start looking at ways to put strings together into 
% arrays, like we did with numbers...To start off, we can use the char function 
% to create a character array. Each 'location' in the array stores exactly one 
% character. Note from the output of the size function that it pads with blanks. 
% So, the last entry has a 'K' followed by a space. Now, we can easily access 
% parts of this array.

variablenames = char('Al','Si','Fe','Mn','Cu','Ni','Zn','Ba','K')
size(variablenames) 
['element ',variablenames(9,:)] %square brackets here allow me to concatenate strings...
['element ',variablenames(8,:)]

%% Downside of Character Arrays
% Let's consider the following example. Assume that we have 12 data files, containing 
% some scalar variable of interest for each month of the year. It might be possible 
% to have the files named like jan.dat, feb.dat, mar.dat, and so on. We could 
% load (more on loading in a few weeks) each data file by 'hard coding' (writing 
% out each one) it in to our code. In other words, we would write out commands 
% to load jan.dat feb.dat, and so on. That is a bit inelegant. It might be nice 
% to instead store the file names (or parts of the file names) in a matrix of 
% sorts, where each entry refers to a give month. We can do this with a character 
% array.

months = char('jan','feb','mar','apr','may','jun','jul','aug','sep','oct','nov','dec')
file1 = [months(8,:),'.dat']

% Ok, that worked nicely. But, remember our problem with padded blanks? But 
% the following case fails badly due to the issue of trailing blanks. Note the 
% case (file3) where we fix the problem using the deblank function. And, a 
% clever (file4) logical indexing case where we keep only the 'non blank' 
% elements of the string. So, there are many ways to get the answer you want, 
% in the end.

months = char('january','february','march','april','may','june','july','aug','september','october',...
    'november','december')
file2 = [months(8,:),'.dat']
file3=[deblank(months(8,:)),'.dat']
I=find(file2~=' ')
file4 = file2(I)

%% Cell Arrays
% Cell arrays are another cool trick. Regular matrices are limited to numeric 
% values. Strings and character arrays are limited to string values. Cell arrays 
% allow you to mix data types in a single 'container.' This is incredibly flexible. 
% Note that things get really tricky here, in terms of what type of 'bracket' 
% you have to use to access certain information. Let us begin by creating a Cell 
% array.

C={'one','two','three'; [1 2], 2, 3} %can store a MIX of data types

% Now, use curly braces to access a particular entry. Remember, Matlab counts 
% down a column first, then moves over to the next one. And, we use smooth braces 
% to access sets of cells. This is pretty much like how we would access a subset 
% of a numeric matrix. Here is where it gets super confusing. We can use a 
% combination of these to access a portion of an entry in a particular location.

C{2}
C{3}

C(1:2,1:2)

C{1}(2)
C{2}(2)

%% 
% So, we could solve out problem of varying month string length. Build of a cell
%array containing the 12 months. When it prints to the screen note that
%there are no 'blanks'. Each entry has its own lenght. This is a huge
%improvement.

months = {'january','february','march','april','may','june','july','aug','september','october',...
    'november','december'}

file=[months{8},'.dat']

%% Structures
% Structures are yet ANOTHER cool trick; a way of grouping together data, of 
% potentially varying types, that belong together. I use structures ALL. THE. 
% TIME. We can create structure 'fields' with the period. What follows the period 
% is the field name. Then, we can assign a value to that field. Below, we build 
% a structure that has three fields, and two entries (values) per field. Note 
% that you can 'nest' structure fields. We COULD have done student.name.last 
% and student.name.first.

student(1).firstname='Greg';
student(2).firstname='Mary';
student(1).lastname='Jones';
student(2).lastname='Smith';
student(1).examscore=[96 95];
student(2).examscore=[87 75];

student

student.firstname

student.lastname

%%
% Now, accessing information in structures can be a little confusing. If we 
% use ( ) notation after the structure name but before the period, you can 
% access a specific entry of a field. If you use ( ) notation both before and 
% after the period you can access a subset of an entry.

student(1).lastname
student(1).lastname(1:3)
student(1).examscore(1)

%% 
% One last time, look at an option for storing and accessing numerous data file 
% names

clear months
months(1).name = 'january';
months(2).name = 'february';
months(3).name = 'march';
months(4).name = 'april';
months(5).name = 'may';
months(6).name = 'june';
months(7).name = 'july';
months(8).name = 'aug';
months(9).name = 'september';
months(10).name = 'october';
months(11).name = 'november';
months(12).name = 'december';

months
months.name
file1=[months(8).name,'.dat']
