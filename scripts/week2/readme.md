# Outline
Today we will cover many basics.

## Live Scripts
Ok, so your basic *script* is an .m file, which is just a simple text file. We can run this file, as we saw in week 1. There are also *live scripts* which are more of an *interactive* experience. You can insert equations, user *controls*, figures, and other things directly into the live script. It is very much like a python notebook in this regard. The one down side of live scripts is that they are binary files, not simple text. Let's do a quick test.

1. Open up [example_simple_script1.m](example_simple_script1.m) in the Matlab editor. This is a simple script, or m-file. Run this file. Nice. By the way, make note of the %% symbols. These create individual *sections* of code. Click on one of these sections and note how it turns yellow. Look up in the ribbon of the editor and you will see a *run section* option. This will execute ONLY the commands in the current section, which can be very helpful. Try running the code all the way through, and then section-by-section.
2. Next, choose *save as* and save the file as a live script. Save it as *example_live_script1.mlx*. This will create a binary file with a .mlx extension. Open this file. It will look a bit different.
3. Run the live script and you should see the variables and the figures appear directly in the code. You can alter where (in-line vs. at the side) where you want your figures to appear (look at the little icons at the far right edge).
4. Next, open up [example_live_script2.mlx](example_live_script2.mlx). Run it. Check out the interactive controls. This is pretty slick. Also note the inserted equations. I have included a few links to lead to you instructions on how to use some of these features.
5. Save this as a .m file. Call it *example_simple_script2.m*. Open it up. Run it. This is pretty disappointing. So, live scripts, with fancy features (like controls) will not convert to equivalent .m files. BUT...it does look like something interesting has happened with the weblinks and the equations...So, for one final test, take this .m file and save it as a live script...call it *test.mlx* or something like that. Now, when you open this up, you will find that the equations and hyperlinks have been recovered, but NOT the controls. 

## Numbers, Vectors, and Matrices
Open up [class2_1.m](class2_1.m). We will run through this section by section. It is all about how numeric data is stored in variables. Knowing where data are and how to access individual elements is critical.

Let's take a break and do [Example 1](student_example1.md), to give you some hands on practice.

## More Matrices!
Open up [class2_2.m](class2_2.m). Let us finish up some further work on arrays.

Ok, head over to [Example 2](student_example2.md) and give it a try.

## Strings, Cells, Structures
Finally, open up [class2_3.m](class2_3.m). Here, we look at how we can store information OTHER than numbers.
