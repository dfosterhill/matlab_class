# In Class Example 2

* Create a matrix of random numbers that has 10 rows and 8 columns. Use *rand* and not *randn*.
* Use the find command to return the row / column subscripts of the values that are greater than 0.4 and less than 0.6.
* Using those row / column subscripts, determine the index values of those matrix locations.
* Finally, extract the actual data values that exist at those locations.
