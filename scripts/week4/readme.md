# Week 4
This week we are going to talk about how to read in data from files, and also how to write data out into files. This 'file input / output' or just file i/o is a very important part of programming. We often have to access data from a governmental agency or other party. Being efficient with working with those files will be a HUGE time savings for you.

## Input
Let's first talk about Matlab functions for reading in data files. There are MANY options. They all have pros and cons and will work in some situations, but not others. I don't care which you use...but you need to develop the expertise so that you can pick the right tool for the job.

Let's start with [this live script](class4_1.mlx). Note that the repository for this week has a whole bunch of files that we will be attempting to read in.

Nice. Now, how about a brief [exercise](student_example1.md) for you to work on?

## Output
Great, now, can we figure out how to *write out* a data file? As was the case with reading in a file, there are sooooo many options to choose from. Some are easy, but not very flexible. Others give you great control over the appearance of the output, but require more care to use. Let us check out the options with this [m-file](class4_2.m).

Great, let's end the day with a short second [exercise](student_example2.md) that will have you write out some data.
