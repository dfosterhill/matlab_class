# In-Class Example 1
Ok, so let us have you practice some programming flow control. I would like you to create a simple script (.m file is fine) that will do the following:
* Make a loop that will execute twenty times
* Each time in the loop, create a single random number. I suggest you use the *randn* function
* Test to see if your random number is positive or negative
* Print out a statement to the command window that both gives the number and then states whether it is positive or negative. For example, you could print out (assuming your number is -1.23) the statement 'The number -1.23 is negative.'
