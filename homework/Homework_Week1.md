1. Ok, this one is easy. All I want you to do is to log in to www.github.com. Create a repository for yourself. Think of this repository as the place where you will store all of your scripts for this term. Initialize the repository with a readme.md file. This 'readme' file is a simple file that explains the point of a repository. Once you have done that, it would be awesome if you could use GitHub Desktop (or git at the command line; LMK if you want to learn that option) to 'clone' the repository to wherever it is that you would like to work. This could be to your personal computer, it could be to the z: space you have on the engineering computers, it is up to you.
2. Also, go over to [this](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2026317/discussion_topics/11275148) canvas discussion and post a reply. This is just to get you familiar with how the discussion feature works in Canvas. Please use this discussion board to ask questions if you ever stuck on anything.
3. If you did not yet do this in class, please clone the class repository to wherever you plan to do your work. Remember, each week, you do a *pull* to get the new files.
4. Finally, make an account at www.mathworks.com. This will allow you to access (download) things from the File Exchange, etc.

Nothing to turn in here, nothing to grade, but please do this in advance of next Tuesday's class.
